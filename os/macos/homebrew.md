## macOS 12 problem

Support for macOS 12 has been removed. If you want to uninstall Homebrew:

$ brew untap $(brew tap)
$ brew cleanup -s
$ rm /usr/local/bin/brew
$ sudo rmdir /usr/local/{Caskroom,Cellar,Frameworks}

```

```console
$ git -C "$(brew --repo)" checkout -b macOS-monterey-freeze 9042eb9
$ git -C "$(brew --repo homebrew/core)" checkout -b macOS-monterey-freeze da66cc3
```

Set these environments to disable auto updating and installing from API:

```sh
export HOMEBREW_NO_AUTO_UPDATE=1
export HOMEBREW_NO_INSTALL_FROM_API=1
```
